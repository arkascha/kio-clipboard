kio-clipboard implements kio-slaves, protocols for KDEs io system. It makes the
content of clipboards available inside file management. That means you can
access the clipboards entries using standard file dialogs like 'File open' or
'Save File', you even can use a file browser and access entries. In general
you can use the slaves wherever you can use an url inside KDE to get access to
the clipboards content. There are no temporary file generated.

Warranty: 
This software comes with no warranties. Use it at own risk.
kio-clipboard was developed and tested under KDE-4.6 running on a GNU/Linux
(openSUSE) on a x86_64 platform. I hope it works under other platforms and
environments.

State:
This is an early and definitely buggy release. Especially There are some issues with actions offered in file managers, "link here" does not work and I cannot suppress it.
There are currently no clipboards supported besides 'klipper' :-(
Since this is my very first KDE implementation please don't rip me to pieces :-)

Roadmap: 
Future versions might add further clipboard types.
Future versions might also be able to access remote (non-local) clipboards, the
current version is limited to the local (current) desktop session.

Details on specific slaves:
* "klipper:/":
This slave implements access to the standard clipboard utility under KDE4,
called 'klipper'. Communication with klipper is done via its dbus interface,
this makes it (relatively) future safe.
* "clipboard:/":
This protocol offers something like a "meta slave". It shows a kind of virtual
folder where all available clipboards are offered. Each clipboard apepars as a
classical folder, standard file operations are supported as far as they make
sense. The specific operations that might be available depend on the clipboard
accessed.

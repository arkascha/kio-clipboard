* Sat Sep 10 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.6
- reorganization of clipboard detection towards a distributed principle
* Sat Aug 20 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.5
- explicit specification of (virtual) file access rights and datetimes in nodes and clipboard folders
- - that does not really control or restrict anything, it is (at least for local clipboards) an optical aspect only
* Fri Aug 19 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.4
- a number of internal reorganizations as preparation for version 0.3 integrating further clipboard applciations/services
- removed caching of entry payloads in memory out of scalability interests
- dropped 'delete' action, this did not really make sense for clipboards
- first introduction of a shared memory cache between separate slave processes
- serialization feature for node wrapper objects, required for later persistent storage of clipboard entries between sessions
- convenience improvements by higher abstraction of node lists
* Wed Aug 10 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.3
- enhanced mime type detection for text based clipboard entries
- detection of a few special types of text entries declared as "code"
- simplified setup up of internal DBus clients
- fixed cardinality of numeric index in displayed entry names to honor the clipboards size
* Sun Aug 07 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.2
- new structure for source file collection
- slightly optimized icons by usage of overlays (for KDE>=4.5)
- fixed 'delete item' action not to delete the target file pointed to (!)
- preparations for translation (i18n)
- implementation of the 'copyToFile' feature for protocols
- implementation of the 'copyFromFile' feature for protocols
- -for human readable files the content will copied to the clipboard instead of the URL or path
- - for all other files or files that exceed the clipboard entries size limit a linking of the URL/path is offered instead
- - the user can chose to accept or cancel
* Sat Jul 30 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.1
- changed technical names of virtual nodes from a numeric index to a check sum
- - this fixes addressing the wrong node after changes to the clipboard that were not reflected in an embedding application
- additional content semantics 'Empty', since such content is not really 'Text'
* Fri Jul 29 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.2.0
- complete rewrite of the internal storage structure
- fixed display name of clipboard folders not to vanish when being clicked
* Tue Jul 27 2011 Christian Reiner: version 0.1

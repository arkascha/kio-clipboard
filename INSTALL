OVERVIEW
The installation is pretty easy. There is no build-time
dependency on Klipper or any library, as kio-clipboard
ships its own repesentation of Klipper's DBus
interface. If it changes, you are screwed, but this
should not happen, as it is official and other programs
will rely on it as well.

INSTALLATION FROM BINARY PACKAGE
If you have a precompiled package matching your system
(architecture and distribution) installation is handled
by the standard tool that comes with the distribution.

BUILD AND INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

# in the source directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install

[sudo make uninstall]

That's it.
You might want to add shortcuts for easier access at a
fewplaces, for example dolphins 'places' sidebar.

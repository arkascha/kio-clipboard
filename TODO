** Features:
- configuration for remote clipboards, cause most likely those cannot be autodetected
- - something like a registration of an url
- signal refresh of list to make dolphin repaint - how ?!?
- - afiestas(#kde-devel): create a kded, monitor clipboard changes from there and use KDirNotify to "simulate"
- turn regex engine in namespace CRI (folder christian-reiner.info) into a header-only-lib
- copy folder currently works recursive, that makes no sense. 
- "link here" does not work, "symlink" is not called and a "permission denied" pops up
** Implementation
- use d-pointers for private members
- - binary compatibility (actually irrelevant for a kio slave...)
- - kde coding conventions (hm...)
** Add support for further clipboards:
- parcellite: simply basic cli clipboard - ? question: any API ?
- pastie: problems with pygobject in numerous setups I tried
- glipper:
- any online clipboard ?
- - pastebin.com: great and mighty API, but requires a key to use it
** Convenience:
- start local clipboard when not running ? (alternative to detectPresence())
- - not during auto detection, but maybe when a slave is selected manually (clicking on it) ?
- - maybe after a message box ("local clipboard not running, you want to start it ?")
